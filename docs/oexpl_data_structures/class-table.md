Introduction
------------

The class table stores information pertaining to all the classes declared in an ExpL program. For a class it stores member fields, member functions, name of the class and parent class pointer.

Structure
---------

The structure of Class Table(CT) is as follows:

âœ›**NOTE**:

Memberfield list is used to store the information regarding the type, name, fieldindex and type of class of all the member fields of that class.

Memberfunc list is used to store the information regarding the type, name of the function, argument list, it's flabel and it's position.

Associated Methods
------------------

*   struct Classtable\* **CInstall**(char \*name,char \*parent\_class\_name) : Creates a class table entry of given 'name' and extends the fields and the methods of parent class.
*   struct Classtable\* **CLookup**(char \*name) : Search for a class table entry with the given 'name', if exists, return pointer to class table entry else return NULL.
*   void **Class\_Finstall**(struct Classtable \*cptr, char \*typename, char \*name) : Installs the field into the given class table entry which is given as an argument.
*   void **Class\_Minstall**(struct Classtable \*cptr, char \*name, struct Typetable \*type, struct Paramstruct \*arglist) : Installs the method into the given class table entry which is given as an argument.

Illustration
------------

Here is an example illustrating it.

1.  As soon as the compiler encounters the class name , it installs the class name and the parent class name if present into the class table. Subsequently, If there is an extension to the parent class, all the member fields and methods of parent class are inherited. Following is how class table looks when _person_ is installed.
