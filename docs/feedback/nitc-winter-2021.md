# Winter 2021, B.Tech Semester 6 Compiler Lab, NIT Calicut

**Total number of students crediting the course: 28.**

**Duration of the course: One semester (13 weeks). Credit Units: 3**

A feedback questionnaire was circulated to all the students who credited the course one week before the end of the semester. The responses are summarized below.

**Major stages of the Project** (Each Stage subsumes the previous Stages):

- Stage 4: Imperative programs without functions. Data types: variables and arrays of integer/string type.
- Stage 5: Imperative programs with functions and recursion. Data types: variables and arrays of integer/string types.
- Stage 6: Imperative programs with support for user defined types and dynamic memory allocation.
- Stage 8: Object oriented programming support for classes and single inheritance.
