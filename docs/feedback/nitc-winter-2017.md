# Winter 2017, B.Tech Semester 6 Compiler Lab, NIT Calicut

**Total number of students crediting the course: 30.**  

**Duration of the course: One semester (13 weeks). Credit Units: 3**  
  
A feedback questionnaire was circulated to all the students who credited the course one week before the end of the semester. The responses are summarized below.

**Major stages of the Project** (Each Stage subsumes the previous Stages):

* Stage 4: Imperative programs without functions. Data types: variables and arrays of integer/string type.
* Stage 5: Imperative programs with functions and recursion. Data types: variables and arrays of integer/string types.
* Stage 6: Imperative programs with support for user defined types and dynamic memory allocation.
* Stage 8: Object oriented programming support for classes and single inheritance.

## Q1. _Student Performance_: How many stages of the project did you complete?

!!! note
    Every student who completed stage 7 also completed stage 8.
  
## Q2. _Time Management_: How many hours of work did you put into the project per week on an average to complete up to what you have done?

## General Observations

1. 87% of students who responded that their programming background was sufficient could complete up to Stage 5 or beyond.
2. 77% of the students who reached Stage 6 went on to complete all the stages up to Stage 8.
3. 87% of the students who completed Stage 5 or beyond noted that 90% or more of the project work can be done only by referring to the project documentation and roadmap.
4. 91% of the students who completed Stage 5 or above noted that every student with average programming skills,
    willing to put in 5-10 hours of work per week should be able to complete the first five stages of the project within one semester.
